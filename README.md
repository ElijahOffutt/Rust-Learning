# 🦀 Learning Computer Science with Rust  

> 🚀 *A structured knowledge base and code ledger for my journey through Computer Science using Rust.*  

## 📖 About This Repository  

**This repository serves as:**  

- 📚 A **ledger** of my understanding and findings as I explore **Computer Science** through **Rust**.  
- 📝 A **Showcase of Understanding**, of syntax, concepts and problem solving using best practices and protocols of Computer Science paradigms and Rust Fundamentals.  
- 💡 A **Journey In Progress** of infinite learning for the betterment of my self and all those who would join me in this wonderful path of education and satisfying our collective curiosity.  

## 🏗️ Structure  

- **📂 `notes/`** → The Obsidian compatible Vault of all my Mark-Down applicable notes with a included list of Obsidian plugins that I used as well in the event that you want to replicate my experience.  
- **📂 `code/`** → Rust programs, exercises, and applied examples including integrations from associative and tangential tooling like JavaScript, TypeScript, etc.  
- **📂 `projects/`** → Mini-projects demonstrating Rust's real-world applications including applications built for web, desktop, mobile and operating systems. These will consist of GitHub Sub-Modules.

## 🛠️ Tools & Methodology  

- ✍️ **Note-Taking:** *Obsidian* (Markdown-based)  
- 🦀 **Programming Language:** *Rust*  
- 🏗 **Version Control:** *Git & GitHub*  
- 🎯 **Focus Areas:** *Memory management, type systems, ownership model, concurrency, and system programming.*

## 💡 Goals  

- 🚀 **Master Rust fundamentals** through applied learning.  
- 🛠️ **Build projects** to reinforce theoretical concepts.  
- 📖 **Document my journey** in an accessible, structured format.  
- 🔄 **Iterate and improve** based on new insights and discoveries.

## 🏆 **Rubric: Project Naming & Taxonomy**  

To maintain **consistency** and **searchability**, associative projects using **Git submodules** will adopt the **acronym** of this repository:  

### **📛 RPLACSE: Rust Programming Language and Computer Science Education**  

- **🔍 Purpose:** This acronym (**RPLACSE**) serves as a unique tag for Rust projects focused on **learning** and **education**.  
- **🏷️ Use Case:** It helps categorize and locate **educational Rust projects** within the ecosystem.  
- **🤝 Community Adoption:** Fellow learners, feel free to use **[RPLACSE]** as a taxonomy tag for your own Rust-based educational projects!  

## 🤝 Contributions  

This is a personal knowledge base, but **discussions, suggestions, and collaborations** are welcome! Feel free to open issues or share insights.
